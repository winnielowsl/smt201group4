## Introduction 
Jakarta, Indonesia’s current capital, has long been struggling with environmental problems. The seawall constructed to protect north Jakarta from the sea is also decreasing by an estimated 25cm per year (Lyons, 2019), Jakarta is sinking very fast and facing an increasing risk of major flooding as days go by. Moving the capital was thus deemed necessary to spread the economic activities, reduce traffic gridlock and also decrease the population density in the overcrowded Java island that is home to almost 60% of the population (Aditya, 2021).

On the other hand, Kalimantan has a very strategic location as it is located in the centre of Indonesia, making it a suitable location for a capital. After conducting in depth studies for 3 years, the government has decided that the new capital will be built in part of North Penajam Paser regency and a part of Kutai Kartanegara regency in East Kalimantan (Lyons, 2019). Most of the government offices, parliament, military and police headquarters will be relocated to the new capital while Jakarta continues serving as Indonesia’ financial and commercial hub (Maulia, 2021).

**Project Motivation**
According to President Joko Widodo, the relocation of the capital would cost 466 trillion rupiah ($32.7bn) (Lyons, 2019). It would thus be important to analyse a variety of factors such as accessibility, economic, transportation, flood risk, safety hazards, environment and other important factors to select a suitable capital site so that precious resources and fundings are not wasted especially in the midst of a pandemic. 

As such, in this project, we studied the selected area (“study area”) and prepared a report of survey highlighting key insights including population density, transportation accessibility, hazard areas including forest fire hotspots and flood risks, and current settlement areas. Finally, site suitability analysis was conducted to select the most suitable area as Indonesia's new capital.

## Project Study Area
In this project, we studied sub-districts and districts of: 

1. Kota Balipapan
2. Kota Samarinda
3. North Penajam Paser (selected):
    * Bubulu, Penajam, Sepaku, Waru
