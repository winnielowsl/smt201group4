## Introduction 
In 2019, Indonesia president Joko Widodo announced a plan to relocate Indonesia's current capital, Jakarta to Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. Part of East Kalimantan will be carved out to make space for the new capital. With such a big shift, how will it affect the country and is relocation a wise choice? As such, in this project, we aim to study the new capital area and conduct site suitability analysis of the study area.
